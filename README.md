# Machine Learning implementation 


Four different machine learning implementation

1. Linear regression implementation

- Exploring different learning rates for batch gradient descent
- Training with non-normalized data
- Feature engineering


2. Logistic regression with L2 and L1 regularization

- Logisitic regression with L2 (Ridge) regularization
- Logisitic regression with L1 (Lasso) regularization


3. Perceptron and Kernels

- Online and Average perceptron
- Perceptron with Polynomial Kernel [online kernerlized perceptron]
- Perceptron with Polynomial Kernel [batch kernelized perceptron]


4. Decision Tree and Random Forest

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
